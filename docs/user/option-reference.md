# Option field reference

An option is offered only where its interface or program declares it. Provider limits and permissions still apply. Fields you define in a custom schema keep that schema’s own meaning; this reference covers the shipped declarations. Setting fields are in the [settings reference](settings-reference.md). Read the plan before a change and [the program guide](register-your-program.md#choose-an-arrangement) before choosing an arrangement.

## Entries

| Reference | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `option:ProviderStartStopBody.force` | Stop a provider even while its own work is stuck. Other work and running turns can still require a separate decision. The record stops at once; the host is told again until it confirms. |
| `option:HostRuntimeStopBody.force` | Apply the same forced-stop behavior to a provider runtime from its host page. Environment runtimes do not support this option and return an explicit refusal. |
| `option:HostRuntimeDeleteQuery.force` | End the provider’s own work that prevents deletion, then remove its runtime with the chosen volume treatment. Work that has committed and a replaced runtime keep their explicit safeguards. |
| `option:ProviderRuntime.detail` | The reason for the runtime’s current state. A forced stop says that host confirmation is pending, then becomes the ordinary person-requested stop once the host confirms. Host-supplied diagnostics remain the host’s own words. |
| `option:ask.models.*.model` | The enabled API model’s routing name. Together with provider_id it identifies one allowed Ask model; child lists can narrow the choices while retaining the parent’s order. |
| `option:ask.models.*.provider_id` | The API provider’s identity for this allowed Ask model. The person and current payer must still be allowed to use that provider and model in the conversation’s organization. |
| `option:AccessOptions.models` | The models. |
| `option:AccessOptions.services` | Enabled provider services this Use grant allows, by name, family or group. Omitted permits every enabled service; this list is independent of generation models. |
| `option:AccessOptions.efforts` | The efforts. |
| `option:AccessOptions.where` | The environment, or the host or machine of one that is to be made, that a refused use was asked for; it tells where the provider's entry does not reach. |
| `option:BindingOptions.viewer_default` | The current creation default and its permitted provenance; absent when rebinding an existing thread. |
| `option:BindingOptions.environment_readers` | The exact prospective page's View offer on the selected existing environment. A new environment is checked in the creator transaction before the thread is made. |
| `option:BindingOptions.defaults` | What settings choose. |
| `option:BindingOptions.providers` | The providers, each with its models and agents. |
| `option:BindingOptions.environments` | Every existing environment the caller manages. This topic's come first (its default, then those its threads use or that were made for it), and the rest follow. |
| `option:BindingOptions.environment_default` | What a new thread does about its environment unless told. |
| `option:BindingOptions.source` | Safe resolved repository settings and the place supplying the repository address. |
| `option:BindingOptions.access` | The permission page that a thread created here would begin with. |
| `option:BindingOptions.agent_access` | Agent privilege choices for this creation context. Rebinding an existing holder does not create another contribution and leaves this field absent. |
| `option:BindingOptions.new_environment` | Who would be able to see, and who to manage, an environment made now for this topic. |
| `option:BindingOptions.can_create` | Whether the caller may make a new environment. |
| `option:BindingOptions.hosts` | The hosts a new environment for a thread here could be made on, the one with the most free memory first: what each has, what is left of it, whether it can be chosen and why not, what it warns about, and whether the scheduler would choose it. Empty where the caller may make no environment here or the place names no template. |
| `option:BindingOptions.machines` | The caller's own connected machines: a thread runs on one through an environment that is a directory there. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.active_turn` | How to treat a turn that is under way. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.wait_minutes` | With waiting: how long to wait before giving up with nothing changed. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.verify_timeout_secs` | How long the health checks may take. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.keep_previous` | Keep what is left behind rather than scheduling it for removal. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.stop_processes` | For a switch out of an environment that others stay in: end this thread's processes there. |
| `option:AppliedChangeOptions.active_turn` | How to treat a turn that is under way. |
| `option:AppliedChangeOptions.wait_minutes` | How long to wait for it. |
| `option:AppliedChangeOptions.verify_timeout_secs` | How long the health checks may take. |
| `option:AppliedChangeOptions.keep_previous` | Whether what is left behind is kept. |
| `option:AppliedChangeOptions.stop_processes` | Whether this thread's processes are ended. |
| `option:ImportOptions.parts` | Which kinds of thing; all three unless given. |
| `option:ImportOptions.versions` | The earlier versions of documents, where the package has them; `true` unless given. |
| `option:ImportOptions.comments` | The discussions of documents; `true` unless given. |
| `option:ImportOptions.access` | Whether the sharing the package carries is restored, within what the importer holds and what the place's locks allow; `false` unless given, and refused for one who does not hold `access.manage` there. |
| `option:ImportOptions.authors` | By whom things are written: the accounts for an Admin of the place, and the importer otherwise. |
| `option:ImportOptions.same_source` | What is done with an object that an earlier import of the same thing made: `replace` unless given. |
| `option:ImportOptions.same_name` | What is done with an object whose name another of the place has: `keep_both` unless given. |

| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.model` | The image model used by the hosted tool, separate from the conversation model. Choose a model the endpoint supports within its allowed options. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.action` | Choose auto, generate or edit. Auto lets the tool choose; editing still needs the image references supplied with the request. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.background` | Choose auto, opaque or transparent. The selected image model and output format must support the requested background. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.output_compression` | The provider’s compression setting from 0 to 100 for JPEG or WebP output, where supported; it does not change the requested image count. |

| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.automatic` | Allow automatic refresh for this target. Off as shipped; explicit Refresh is separate. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.on` | Events that may trigger automatic refresh. Omission uses this target’s ordinary events; an empty list disables event triggers. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.min_interval_secs` | Minimum automatic-refresh interval in seconds; zero adds no minimum gap. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.context_tokens` | Positive input token budget; otherwise the summarizer default is 32,000, within the available model window less output. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.output_chars` | Positive output character budget. This never overrides provider limits or usage caps. |
| `option:SummaryOptionsBody.options` | The target’s own options; null removes the override and restores inheritance. |
| `option:SummaryOptionsBody.expected_revision` | The options revision read by the caller, so a changed choice must be reviewed again. |
| `option:protocols.anthropic-messages.native_tools.page_fetch.request.max_uses` | Maximum page-fetch tool uses in this request, when set. |
| `option:protocols.anthropic-messages.native_tools.page_fetch.request.allowed_domains` | Only fetch pages from the listed domains; it cannot be set together with blocked domains. |

| `option:protocols.anthropic-messages.native_tools.page_fetch.request.citations.enabled` | Turns citations for fetched pages on or off. |
| `option:ModelGroupOptions.request_options` | Request option forms and constraints keyed by interface; `native` names program parameters. The endpoint, group and offering constraints still apply. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints` | Public key-format hints that propose this preset and a credential role. They never verify a key or enable an offering; the normal first read after saving confirms the vendor facts. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints.*.prefix` | The plain public beginning of a key format. Matching only proposes a choice; the complete key stays in the form until Save. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints.*.role` | The proposed role: model access or an admin credential for the facts source. A role the client does not recognize requires an explicit supported choice. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints.*.field` | Optional declared secret-field name for the proposed admin credential in the selected facts source. It is kept separate from model access and must be offered by that source. |
