# Option field reference

An option is offered only where its interface or program declares it. Provider limits and permissions still apply. Fields you define in a custom schema keep that schema’s own meaning; this reference covers the shipped declarations. Setting fields are in the [settings reference](settings-reference.md). Read the plan before a change and [the program guide](register-your-program.md#choose-an-arrangement) before choosing an arrangement.

## Entries

| Reference | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `option:Support.execution` | The actual program adapter reports implemented input/result codecs and verified streaming, read-tool bridge and confinement support. A delegated mode or provider name alone proves none of them. |
| `option:Route.execution` | Required input/result codecs and execution facilities for this route. Preview and execution both require matching installed code; choosing a route starts no work. |
| `option:ResolvedRoute.execution` | The exact declared consumer requirements retained with the selected route until execution. They are technical requirements, not credentials or access grants. |
| `option:ExecutionSupport.input` | The exact input codec identifier understood by the installed adapter. Different request shapes need their actual codec. |
| `option:ExecutionSupport.result` | The exact result codec identifier. A text answer, viewed file or attached image does not prove another result family. |
| `option:ExecutionSupport.streaming` | True only when native incremental events and durable replay are implemented; required by consumers that stream answers. |
| `option:ExecutionSupport.read_tools` | True only when a source-bound read-tool bridge is implemented. This does not grant source Read. |
| `option:ExecutionSupport.confined_tools` | True only when native execution is verified to confine tools to the admitted consumer catalogue. An instruction asking the program to behave is insufficient. |
| `option:Resolution.reason` | A safe reason why the chosen capability route is unavailable. execution_codec_unavailable means its installed executor lacks a required codec or facility; program_execution_unavailable means the native adapter has not verified this consumer. No other provider is selected automatically. |
| `option:PersonalState.sidebar.open_links` | The person’s Open links in choice, kept with sidebar state: automatic by default, this or new. Automatic keeps each destination in one view; this replaces the current view and new opens a view. An already open target is focused. Choose it in Interface or a tab menu; explicit clones and browser modifier clicks keep their usual behavior. |
| `option:TopicSearch.q` | The thread-name search on a topic’s Overview and Threads tab. It filters the visible live collection, travels in the topic address and is not retained as a device default. |
| `option:codex.cyber_access_program` | The Codex access program offered by the model and enabled for the provider. The selected name reaches the native turn unchanged, including names outside the Daybreak family. Normal model/account eligibility and provider access still apply. |
| `option:InputScheduleCreateBody.plan` | The authored Plan choice of every future occurrence. Required at creation; true requests a planning turn and false requests work. It is kept when the occurrence is accepted, including when an ordinary mode boundary makes it wait. |
| `option:InputScheduleCreateBody.delivery` | Required queue, steer or interrupt choice for future input. Saved and rechecked through the ordinary input writer when due; creating a schedule does not deliver it immediately. |
| `option:InputScheduleUpdateBody.plan` | An explicit Plan change is an author-only, revision-checked definition edit. Omission keeps the reviewed choice. |
| `option:InputScheduleUpdateBody.delivery` | An explicit queue, steer or interrupt change is an author-only, revision-checked definition edit. Omission keeps the reviewed choice; pausing or resuming alone does not replace it. |
| `option:ThreadGoalUpdateBody.action` | Pause, resume, or accept an unchecked completion report. Accept is the person's explicit Mark met decision; Resume on an unchecked report means Keep working and claims no verification. |
| `option:AgentProfile.config.native_result_wait_ms` | Codex's optional retained-result wait in milliseconds. Omission uses the registered system default, fitted within the engine's interrupt window. A profile's explicit valid wait is kept or refused with its reason. |
| `option:AgentProfile.config.native_result_buffer_bytes` | Codex's optional byte budget for ordered later input during an evidence read. Omission uses the registered system default. Pressure ends optional proof without dropping input or stopping another session. |
| `option:SessionSettings.web_action_wait_secs` | The resolved inherited native web-row wait sent to an agent session. Codex uses receipt time and retains ownership for a late real end; the wait never interrupts the turn. |
| `option:SessionOpen.web_action_wait_secs` | Required resolved web-row wait on the connector's session-open command, carried into the session settings and its reopen fingerprint. |
| `option:x_turn_end_delays.delays.*.default_setting` | The program's declared system registry key supplying an omitted profile wait in milliseconds. The engine resolves it and fits that default under its interrupt window; an explicit profile wait is not shortened. |
| `option:x_turn_end_delays.delays.*.pending_buffer` | A program's declaration of optional ordered-input buffering during its evidence wait. Pressure must end optional evidence and continue the input, rather than drop or refuse frames. |
| `option:x_turn_end_delays.delays.*.pending_buffer.pointer` | JSON pointer to this byte budget in the program profile's configuration. An explicit valid profile value is retained. |
| `option:x_turn_end_delays.delays.*.pending_buffer.default_bytes` | The program's fallback byte default. The engine supplies the declared registered system default when the profile leaves the pointer unset. |
| `option:x_turn_end_delays.delays.*.pending_buffer.default_setting` | The declared system registry key for the pending-input byte default. It must name an available unsigned integer setting. |
| `option:ask.models.*.model` | The enabled API model’s routing name. Together with provider_id it identifies one allowed Ask model; child lists can narrow the choices while retaining the parent’s order. |
| `option:ask.models.*.provider_id` | The API provider’s identity for this allowed Ask model. The person and current payer must still be allowed to use that provider and model in the conversation’s organization. |
| `option:EverythingListQuery.resource_rows` | Return compact table rows and the readable sharing summary once per home in the page. Full configuration is read from each resource when opened. |
| `option:EverythingListQuery.resource_details` | Return full resource views when table rows are not requested. This is used by choices that draw the full configuration. |
| `option:ThreadOpeningGetQuery.limit` | Positive item count for this opening, overriding the resolved threads.opening_items default. Older items remain available through history cursors. |
| `option:ThreadOpeningGetQuery.continuation_id` | Choose the history continuation for this read without changing which continuation executes. |
| `option:ThreadOpeningGetQuery.projection_revision` | Name the known history projection. A stale value returns the native reset with sync.complete=false and the current selector, which can be used to open a fresh window. |
| `option:ThreadModelParameter.options_partial` | True when additional model choices are deferred. Read the full thread parameters when opening the model chooser. |
| `option:AccessOptions.models` | The models. |
| `option:AccessOptions.services` | Enabled provider services this Use grant allows, by name, family or group. Omitted permits every enabled service; this list is independent of generation models. |
| `option:AccessOptions.efforts` | The efforts. |
| `option:AccessOptions.where` | The environment, or the host or machine of one that is to be made, that a refused use was asked for; it tells where the provider's entry does not reach. |
| `option:BindingOptions.viewer_default` | The current creation default and its permitted provenance; absent when rebinding an existing thread. |
| `option:BindingOptions.environment_readers` | The exact prospective page's View offer on the selected existing environment. A new environment is checked in the creator transaction before the thread is made. |
| `option:BindingOptions.defaults` | What settings choose. |
| `option:BindingOptions.providers` | The providers, each with its models and agents. |
| `option:BindingOptions.environments` | Every existing environment the caller manages. This topic's come first (its default, then those its threads use or that were made for it), and the rest follow. |
| `option:BindingOptions.environment_default` | What a new thread does about its environment unless told. |
| `option:BindingOptions.default_environment` | The environment the nearest setting names as the default, wherever it is set, and why the reader cannot use it when they cannot; absent when no setting names one and when an existing thread is bound again. |
| `option:BindingOptions.source` | Safe resolved repository settings and the place supplying the repository address. |
| `option:BindingOptions.access` | The permission page that a thread created here would begin with. |
| `option:BindingOptions.agent_access` | Agent privilege choices for this creation context. Rebinding an existing holder does not create another contribution and leaves this field absent. |
| `option:BindingOptions.new_environment` | Who would be able to see, and who to manage, an environment made now for this topic. |
| `option:BindingOptions.can_create` | Whether the caller may make a new environment. |
| `option:BindingOptions.hosts` | The hosts a new environment for a thread here could be made on, the one with the most free memory first: what each has, what is left of it, whether it can be chosen and why not, what it warns about, and whether the scheduler would choose it. Empty where the caller may make no environment here or the place names no template. |
| `option:BindingOptions.machines` | The caller's own connected machines: a thread runs on one through an environment that is a directory there. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.active_turn` | How to treat a turn that is under way. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.wait_minutes` | With waiting: how long to wait before giving up with nothing changed. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.verify_timeout_secs` | How long the health checks may take. |
| `option:ChangeOptions.keep_previous` | Keep what is left behind rather than scheduling it for removal. |

| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.action` | Choose auto, generate or edit. Auto lets the tool choose; editing still needs the image references supplied with the request. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.background` | Choose auto, opaque or transparent. The selected image model and output format must support the requested background. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.output_compression` | The provider’s compression setting from 0 to 100 for JPEG or WebP output, where supported; it does not change the requested image count. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.output_format` | The requested image encoding: PNG, JPEG or WebP. This does not prove the format of returned bytes; the result keeps its reported format. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.partial_images` | Request 0 to 3 streaming previews. A preview is not another completed image; the provider may include preview work in its token usage. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.quality` | The requested rendering quality. Use only levels supported by the selected image model and its option constraints. |
| `option:protocols.openai-responses.native_tools.image_generation.request.size` | The requested dimensions or auto, within the selected image model’s supported sizes. It does not override provider limits. |

| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.automatic` | Allow automatic refresh for this target. Off as shipped; explicit Refresh is separate. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.on` | Events that may trigger automatic refresh. Omission uses this target’s ordinary events; an empty list disables event triggers. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.min_interval_secs` | Minimum automatic-refresh interval in seconds; zero adds no minimum gap. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.context_tokens` | Positive input token budget; otherwise the summarizer default is 32,000, within the available model window less output. |
| `option:SummaryTargetOptions.output_chars` | Positive output character budget. This never overrides provider limits or usage caps. |
| `option:SummaryOptionsBody.options` | The target’s own options; null removes the override and restores inheritance. |
| `option:SummaryOptionsBody.expected_revision` | The options revision read by the caller, so a changed choice must be reviewed again. |
| `option:protocols.anthropic-messages.native_tools.page_fetch.request.max_uses` | Maximum page-fetch tool uses in this request, when set. |
| `option:protocols.anthropic-messages.native_tools.page_fetch.request.allowed_domains` | Only fetch pages from the listed domains; it cannot be set together with blocked domains. |

| `option:protocols.anthropic-messages.native_tools.page_fetch.request.citations.enabled` | Turns citations for fetched pages on or off. |
| `option:ModelGroupOptions.request_options` | Request option forms and constraints keyed by interface; `native` names program parameters. The endpoint, group and offering constraints still apply. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints` | Public key-format hints that propose this preset and a credential role. They never verify a key or enable an offering; the normal first read after saving confirms the vendor facts. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints.*.prefix` | The plain public beginning of a key format. Matching only proposes a choice; the complete key stays in the form until Save. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints.*.role` | The proposed role: model access or an admin credential for the facts source. A role the client does not recognize requires an explicit supported choice. |
| `option:providers.presets.*.credential_hints.*.field` | Optional declared secret-field name for the proposed admin credential in the selected facts source. It is kept separate from model access and must be offered by that source. |
